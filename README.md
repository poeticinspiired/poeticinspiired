## 🧠 The Neurodivergent Advantage

<div align="center">

### Not a Bug. A Feature.

</div>

My neurodivergence isn't something I work *despite*—it's my **superpower**:

🔍 **Pattern Recognition** → I see connections others miss  
🌊 **Deep Focus States** → When I lock in, magic happens (usually 11 PM - 3 AM)  
🎯 **Systems Thinking** → Natural gift for architectural design  
💡 **Creative Problem-Solving** → The "weird" approach that actually works

**Real Talk:** The tech industry needs diverse minds. Different brains solve different problems. My journey from philosophy to production systems proves there's no "right" path to impact.
